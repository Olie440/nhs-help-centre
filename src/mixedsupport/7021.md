title: What does reference CID7021 mean?

If reference CID7021 is shown, this means the website or app you are trying to visit needs to connect to your GP surgery’s system and we have not been able to make that connection.

This might be because you do not have permission from your GP to use your GP surgery’s online services.

You should ask your GP surgery to check if you are able to use their online services.
