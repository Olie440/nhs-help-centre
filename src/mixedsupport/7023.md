If reference CID7023 is shown, this means the website or app you are trying to visit needs to connect to your GP surgery’s system and we have not been able to make that connection.

This is because you have already set up an NHS login using a different email address. We have connected that NHS login to your GP surgery’s system. You can only connect 1 NHS login to your GP surgery’s system.

If you want to change the email address on your NHS login you can do so in your [NHS login settings](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ "NHS login settings").

If you need help or do not think you have already set up an NHS login, you should contact us.
