If the camera does not open or shows a black screen when recording a video, this may be a problem with permissions.

You should make sure the web browser on your device has camera and microphone permissions. You must also give permission for the NHS login website to access your device’s camera and microphone.

## iOS devices

If you have an iOS device, updating the iOS operating system software on your device to a newer version may also help, if available. Version 11.2 iOS will always show a black screen when trying to open the camera. There is an [Apple support article](https://support.apple.com/en-gb "Apple support article") that describes how to check for updates.

## Android devices

If you have an Android device, you should avoid the ‘camera’ option when given a choice of applications to record the video with. You should choose a video option instead, like ‘camcorder’ or ‘capture video’.
