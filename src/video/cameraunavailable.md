If your gallery or file manager opens instead of your camera when trying to record a video, you may have an issue with permissions.

You must give permission for your web browser to access the camera and microphone. If your web browser does not have permission, you will not be given the option to use the camera.

You must also give permission for the NHS login website to access your deviceâ€™s camera and microphone.

If this problem keeps happening even with permissions allowed, there might be a problem with your device. You can try opening your camera app separately to record a video.

If this does not work, you can also try recording a video on another device. For example, you can use another phone or tablet that belongs to you or a family member.
