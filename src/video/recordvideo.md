To record a good short video, make sure:
* your entire face is visible
* you face the camera directly
* your face is not covered by a hat or glasses

You will be asked to repeat 4 randomly generated numbers. You can say the numbers out loud or write them down and show them.

If you say the numbers, make sure your voice is loud and clear. If you write the numbers down, make sure they are clear and the paper is not held in front of your face.
