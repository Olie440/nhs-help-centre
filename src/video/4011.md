If reference CID4011 is shown, this is because your video has failed to upload. If this keeps happening there may be a problem with your internet connection, or a technical problem on our side.

You can try uploading your video another time or use a better internet connection. For example, you should make sure you are using a good Wi-Fi connection. Try using a different Wi-Fi connection if the one you are using does not work.
