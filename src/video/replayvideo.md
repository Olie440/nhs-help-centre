If you cannot replay your video, this could be because the video format captured by your device camera is not supported by your browser.

We are testing ways to support additional video formats. In the meantime, users can change the video format of the device to a supported format.

For example:
* video/mp4
* video/webm

If this does not work, you can also try recording a video on another device. For example, you can use another phone or tablet that belongs to you or a family member.
