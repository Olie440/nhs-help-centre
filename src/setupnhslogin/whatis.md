NHS login lets you access a variety of digital health and care websites and apps with just 1 username and password.

To access some websites and apps, you may need to prove who you are. You only have to do this once. This is so we can connect you to your NHS record and protect your health information.

When you have proved who you are, you will be able to use your NHS login to access websites and apps wherever you see 'NHS login'.

Benefits include:
* a one-time set up process
* a single login for different websites and apps
* secure and protected health and care data
