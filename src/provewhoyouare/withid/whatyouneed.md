You will be asked to:
1. take a photo of your I.D.
2. record your face using your device
3. enter your NHS number if you know it

Your photo I.D. can be a:
* passport
* UK driving licence (full or provisional)
* European driving licence (full)
* European national identity card

We ask you to record your face so that we can compare it to your photo I.D. and prove who you are. We may ask you for more details to help find your NHS record, like your date of birth or postcode.
