We run a virus check on the photo of your I.D. If the file you upload is infected or damaged, you can try and upload another one.

If this keeps happening, there might be a problem with your device. Try taking a photo using a different device. For example, you can use another phone or tablet that belongs to you or a family member.

Send the photo to your usual device and try uploading it again. Or, you can upload your photo from the other device just to prove who you are. Once you have proven who you are, you can then use NHS login on your usual device as normal.
