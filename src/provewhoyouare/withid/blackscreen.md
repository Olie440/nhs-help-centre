If the camera does not open or shows a black screen when taking a photo, this may be a problem with permissions or a known bug in the operating system.

You should make sure the web browser on your device has camera and microphone permissions. You must also give permission for the NHS login website to access your deviceâ€™s camera and microphone.

If you are using an iOS device, updating the iOS operating system software on your device to a newer version may also help. Version 11.2 will always show a black screen when trying to open the camera.

There is an [Apple support article](https://support.apple.com/en-gb "Apple support article") that describes how to check for updates.
