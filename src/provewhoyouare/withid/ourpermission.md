Your web browser should tell you any time a site requests access to your camera or microphone. This usually happens when you visit a website for the first time. You will be given the option to select ‘allow’ or ‘block’.

If you select ‘block’ the NHS login website will not be able to access your camera or microphone. You can change this by going to your web browser settings.

## Chrome

If you are using Google Chrome, select the icon to the left of the web page address in the address bar. This will allow you to view and change the permissions for the website you are on.

You can also go to Chrome’s settings and select the ‘privacy and security’ tab. Select ‘site settings’ to view and change permissions for your camera and microphone.

## Internet Explorer

If you are using Internet Explorer, go to the web browser’s settings page. Select ‘advanced settings’ and then ‘manage permissions’ to view and change permissions for your camera and microphone.

## Firefox

If you are using Firefox, you can select the website’s icon in your address bar and click ‘more information’.

Firefox also has a permissions manager that lets you see which permissions you have set up for different websites and change them all in one place. To access it, enter ‘about:permissions’ into your Firefox address bar.

## Safari

If you are using Safari, select ‘preferences’ to open the preferences window. You can then select the ‘security’ tab and ‘manage website settings’ to view and change permissions for your camera and microphone.
