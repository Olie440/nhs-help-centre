If you see the error reference code CID4002, this is because the picture of your photo I.D. has failed to upload. If this keeps happening there may be a problem with your internet connection, or a technical problem on our side.

You can try uploading a photo of your I.D. another time or use a better internet connection. For example, you should make sure you are using Wi-Fi instead of your phone’s cellular data. Try using a different Wi-Fi connection if the one you are using doesn’t work.

If you keep getting this message, contact us so we can try to fix the problem.
