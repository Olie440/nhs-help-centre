Tell your GP surgery that you want to register for their online services. They will ask you to fill in a form.

You will then be given 3 registration details:
* Linkage Key (could be called Passphrase)
* O.D.S. Code (could be called Organisation Code or Practice I.D.)
* Account I.D.

You can use these 3 registration details to prove who you are instead of sending a photo of your I.D. You cannot use the username and password you use to log into your GP surgery’s online services.
