Reference CID2020 is shown when the registration details from your GP surgery’s online services are invalid. This means we cannot connect you to your GP surgery’s online services.

This could be because:
* you have changed GP surgery
* your GP surgery has changed systems
* you do not have permission to use your GP surgery’s online services

You can ask your GP for new registration details for their online services. You can use these new details to try to prove who you are.
