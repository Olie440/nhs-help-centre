## Wrong details – Reference CID7001

Reference CID7001 is shown when 1 or more of the details you enter are wrong. This could be because you have wrongly entered 1 or more of your 3 registration details from your GP surgery’s online services. Or, it could mean the name and date of birth you entered does not match what is on your NHS record.

You can try again, making sure you enter the correct details.

If this keeps on happening, contact your GP surgery to check you have the right registration details. If you have the right details, ask your GP surgery to check your name and date of birth is correct and up to date on your NHS record.

## You need permission to use your GP surgery’s online services – Reference CID7002

Speak to your GP as you may need permission to access your GP surgery’s online services.

If you are trying to prove who you are, you can do this using photo I.D. instead. You will not need the registration details from your GP surgery’s online services to do this.

If you are trying to use the NHS App you should speak to your GP surgery about using their online services.

Contact your GP surgery to check you have the right registration details. If you have the right details, ask your GP surgery to check your name and date of birth is correct and up to date on your NHS record.
