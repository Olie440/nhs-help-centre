Reference CID7004 is shown when the registration details from your GP surgery’s online services have already been used to set up an NHS login. This can happen if you are trying to set up a new NHS login with a different email address.

You can use the 3 registration details from your GP surgery’s online services only once to set up an NHS login. Once you have used them once, you cannot use them again on a different NHS login using a different email address.

If you want to change the email address on your NHS login you can do so by going to your [NHS login settings](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ "NHS login settings").

If you think that someone else may have used your 3 registration details to set up an NHS login, you should contact us for help.
