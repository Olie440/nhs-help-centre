You should be able to manage your NHS login settings from within the websites and apps that use NHS login. Each website and app you visit may offer a different way for you to access your [NHS login settings](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ "NHS login settings").

Contact the providers of the website or app you are using if you cannot find a way to access your NHS login settings.
