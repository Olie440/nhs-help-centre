At present there is no option to manage your NHS login settings within the NHS App. This is something we are currently working towards.

However, you can do this by selecting this link:

[https://settings.login.nhs.uk/](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ "NHS login settings").

For security reasons, you will need to log in with your usual NHS login details before you can change any of your details.
