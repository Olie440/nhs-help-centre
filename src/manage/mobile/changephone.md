You can change your phone number by visiting your [NHS login settings](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ "NHS login settings"). Under the heading ‘your personal information’ select ‘change phone number’.

To visit your NHS login settings, you first need to log in with your NHS login details. To do this, you need access to your previous mobile phone or phone number that is currently on your NHS login.
