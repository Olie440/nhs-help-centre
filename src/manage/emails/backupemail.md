When you first set up an NHS login you are given the option to add a backup email address. This is a second email address that you own, which will help to secure your NHS login.

For example, your backup email address can be used if you lose access to your mobile phone number. We can use it to send you a confirmation link, which will allow you to log in and change the mobile phone number on your NHS login.

We can also use your backup email address to contact you if there is suspicious activity on your NHS login.

If you did not add a backup email address when you set up your NHS login, you can do so by going to your [NHS login settings](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ "NHS login settings"). Go to the heading ‘backup methods’ and select ‘add email’. You can also remove or change an existing backup email address.
