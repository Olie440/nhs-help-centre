You can remove any of your remembered devices by going to your [NHS login settings](https://settings.login.nhs.uk/ "NHS login settings"). Under the heading ‘remembered devices’ select ‘remove device’ next to the device you want to remove from your NHS login.

If you use NHS login on that device again, you will need to enter a security code we send to your phone.
