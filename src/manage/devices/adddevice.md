When you log in and enter your 6-digit security code, you have the option to select ‘remember this device and stop sending security codes’. If you select this, you will not need to enter a security code each time you log in with the same device in future.

To keep your NHS login secure, you should only do this on your own personal or trusted devices. For security, we may ask you from time to time if you still want us to remember your device.
